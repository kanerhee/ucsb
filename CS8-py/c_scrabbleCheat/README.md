Scrabble Cheater created with  Python 3.0
Uses the file wordlist.txt which contains a list of every "valid" word accepted for points in Scrabble.
Prompts input for what letters a user has at their hand, and outputs every combination of those letters that can
create a word from wordlist.txt as well as the amount of points each word would yield, in order from highest 
amount of points to lowest.
